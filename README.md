# Project template

This is a simple python-based scientific project repository. Each project has an accompanying conda environment, with the dependencies specified in the env.yaml. The docs folder contains markdown templates for a labbook and a literature review. There is also a 'paper skeleton', that is a file in which to dump all the relevant information before proceeding with writing up a project for publication.
